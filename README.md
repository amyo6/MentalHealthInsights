# ðŸ§  Mental Health Insights in Young Adults â€” Group Data Project
Team: 
Gina Tran, Caleb Lee, Halle Hwang, Amy Ojuejiofor, Simran Kaur 

This project was a collaborative group effort to explore and uncover insights about mental health in young adult populations using publicly available healthcare data. Our datasets were sourced from platforms such as Kaggle, the CDC, and various online health surveys.

As a team of five, we all worked with R as our primary programming language. Each team member explored a research question of their choice related to mental health, and we used a shared data wrangling and visualization workflow that included libraries such as:

- dplyr for data manipulation
- ggplot2 for visualizations
- tidyverse for streamlined data processing

After completing our individual analyses and visualizations, we combined our code to build an interactive Shiny web application that brings together our findings in a user-friendly interface.

This project not only helped us practice technical R programming skills but also deepened our understanding of key trends in mental health among young adults.
